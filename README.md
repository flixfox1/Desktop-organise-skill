## The Philosophy

**Your desktop should be a temporary workspace, not permanent storage.**

### Core Principles
- **Minimal Desktop**: Keep only 3-5 essential app shortcuts
- **Smart Categorization**: Files organized by type and purpose
- **Quick Access**: Frequently used items stay accessible
- **Clean Workflow**: Weekly maintenance keeps it organized
